Abstract
This capstone project lays out a framework with a user-friendly toolkit for modeling users engagement states as a markov chain, using it for prediction of future engagement states and calculating the Lifetime Value for each engagement group. It consists of:
Case study in practice: example of analysis and insights at Via Transportation, Inc.
R Coding Tutorial for replicating this analysis, implemented by transferring such analysis onto a dataset of donations for democratic elections campaigns, specifically donations to Bernie Sanders’ donations from 2015-2016, through ActBlue donations platform.
The goal of this capstone is manifold:
1. Promote an underutilized academic methodology (inspired by Pfeifer & Carraway, 2000) of using markov models to predict user states and lifetime value into practical usage in private settings - where customer lifetime value is utilized and needed most.
2. Do the above through teaching R code (with best practices), to help new learners and professionals utilize this methodology while advancing their technical skills, yet most importantly - critically thinking and altering this analysis to fit their needs; since no one environment is alike. There needs to be a high level of touch, such that this R tutorial forces a user with sufficient skills and time to critically think and alter needed elements of this analysis. 
3. Apply this analysis to Via transportation Inc, gather conclusions and impact relevant decisions in the company.
4. Transfer this analysis further into a political sphere and donations data rather then for-profit data, show that it is useful there, and provide the insights derived from this analysis that could be useful for future democratic political campaigns specifically or donation campaigns in general. 

In this repository you will find:
- The coding tutorial and application of this analysis on the ActBlue donations data, in the R Markdown Notebook ("[Actblue Markov Tutorial](https://github.com/tomereldor/Capstone/blob/master/Actblue_Markov_Tutorial_3_for_publishing.Rmd)"). This is mostly if you want to download the code. If you want to see it in action, go to [rpubs.com/tomereldor/actblue](http://rpubs.com/tomereldor/actblue).

- DATA: The Dataset was too big to upload here, but you can get my already processed files from my drive (request permission if needed and I will grant it) [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19FZoWqePhnudd7lentiQue8hje8RbGzZ).
